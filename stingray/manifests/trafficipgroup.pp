# == Define: trafficipgroup
#
# Create a Stingray Traffic Manager Traffic IP Group. A traffic IP group
# is a set of IP addresses that will be distributed across a number of
# Stingray Traffic Managers. If a Stingray Traffic Manager fails,
# any IP addresses in the traffic IP group that were assigned to it
# will be redistributed across the remaining traffic managers. This
# provides fault tolerance.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
# The name of the traffic ip group.
#
# [*ipaddresses*]
# The IP Address associated with this traffic ip group.
#
# [*machines*]
# A list of the Stingray Traffic Managers to associate with this traffic
# ip group. The default is this node.
#
# [*passive*]
# Of the Stingray Traffic Managers associate with this traffic ip group,
# which are passive?  Stingray Traffic managers in passive mode won't
# have any IP addresses assigned to them unless a failure has occurred.
#
# [*keeptogether*]
# If set to 'yes' then all the traffic IPs will be raised on a single
# Stingray Traffic Manager. The default is 'no' which means the traffic IPs
# are distributed across all active Stingray Traffic Managers in the
# traffic ip group.
#
# [*enabled*]
# Enable this traffic ip group and raise all the IP Addresses?  The default
# is 'no'.
#
# === Examples
#
#  stingray::trafficipgroup { 'My Traffic IP Group':
#      ipaddress => ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2'],
#      machines  => ['my stm', 'my stm 2'],
#      passive   => 'my stm 2',
#      enabled   => 'yes'
#  }
