# == Define: del_monitor
#
# Delete a Stingray Traffic Manager monitor class.  Monitors watch the
# nodes in a pool, and inform Stingray if the nodes are functioning
# correctly. They work by sending small requests that expect a set reply.
# If they don't receive the reply they want, the test fails and Stingray
# is notified.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
# The name of the monitor class to delete.
#
# === Examples
#
#  stingray::del_monitor { 'My Monitor':
#  }
