# == Define: pool
#
# Create a Stingray Traffic Manager pool.  A pool manages a group of
# server nodes. It routes traffic to the most appropriate node, based on
# load balancing and session persistence criteria.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
# The name of the pool.
#
# [*nodes*]
# An list of the nodes in host:port format.
#
# [*weightings*]
# Path to the license key file. Providing no license key file defaults to
# developer mode.
#
# [*disabled*]
# A list of the nodes in host:port format that are disabled.  When a node
# is disabled, all currently established connections to that node will
# be terminated and no further requests will be sent to it.
#
# [*draining*]
# A list of the nodes in host:port format that are draining.  When a node
# is draining, it will not receive any new connections other than those
# in sessions already established. To remove a node from a pool safely,
# it should be drained first.
#
# [*monitors*]
# An array of the monitors for this pool.  A pool can have multiple monitors.
# Monitors watch the nodes in a pool, and inform Stingray if the nodes are
# functioning correctly.  Stingray contains a number of builtin monitors.
# You can also create custom monitors, please see monitor.pp for more
# details on creating custom monitors.  The default monitor for a pool
# is the builtin 'Ping' monitor.
#
# [*algorithm*]
# The Load Balancing algorithm to use.  The default is Round Robin.
#
# Valid values are:
#    'Round Robin':  Assign requests in turn to each node.
#    'Weighted Round Robin':  Assign requests in turn to each node,
#                             in proportion to thieir weights.
#    'Perceptive': Predict the most appropriate node using a combination
#                  of historical and current data.
#    'Least Connections': Assign each request to the node with the
#                         fewest connections
#    'Weighted Least Connections': Assign each request to a node based on the
#                                  number of concurrent connections to the node
#                                  and its weight.
#    'Fastest Response Time': Assign each request to the node with the fastest
#                             response time.
#    'Random Node': Choose a random node for each request.
#
# [*persistence*]
# The Session Persistence class to use for this pool.  Session Persistence
# ensures that all requests from a client will always get sent to the same
# node. The default is to not use Session Persistence.
#
# [*bandwidth*]
# The bandwidth management class to use. Bandwidth classes are used to
# limit the network resources that a set of connections can consume.
# When applied to a pool, they limit the bandwidth sending data to
# that pool.
#
# [*maxconns*]
# The maximum number of concurrent connections allowed to each back-end
# node in this pool per machine. A value of 0 means unlimited connections.
# The default value is 0 (unlimited connections).
#
# === Examples
#
#  stingray::pool { 'My Pool':
#        nodes => ['192.168.22.121:80', '192.168.22.122:80']
#  }
#
#  stingray::pool { 'My Other Pool':
#        nodes      => ['192.168.22.121:80', '192.168.22.122:80'],
#        weightings => {'192.168.22.121:80' => 1,
#                       '192.168.22.122:80' => 2},
#        algorithm  => 'Least Connections'
#  }
