# == Define: virtual_server
#
# Create a Stingray Traffic Manager virtual server.  A virtual server
# accepts network traffic and processes it. It normally gives each
# connection to a pool; the pool then forwards the traffic to a server node.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
# The name of the virtual server.
#
# [*address*]
# The IP Address for this virtual server to listen on.
#
# Valid values are:
#     - '*' which means to listen to all IP Addresses on this host.
#     - A list of Traffic IP Groups prepended with an '!'.
#       For example: address => ['!TIP 1', '!TIP 2'],
#     - A list of IP Address and/or domain names.  The virtual server will
#       take all the traffic on its port for all domain names and IPs listed.
#
# The default value is '*' (listen to all IP Addresses).
#
# [*port*]
# The port this virtual server listens on.  This must be a numerical
# value, it cannot be '*'.  The default is '80'.
#
# [*protocol*]
# The protocol your clients and back-end nodes use. Setting it correctly
# will allow protocol-specific features, such as rules that edit this
# protocol's headers, to work properly. The default value is 'HTTP'.
#
# Valid values are:
#    'HTTP'        'Telnet'             'DNS (TCP)'
#    'FTP'         'SSL'                'SIP (UDP)'
#    'IMAPv2'      'SSL (HTTPS)'        'SIP (TCP)'
#    'IMAPv3'      'SSL (POP3S)'        'RTSP'
#    'IMAPv4'      'SSL (LDAPS)'        'Generic Server First'
#    'POP3'        'UDP -Streaming'     'Generic Client First'
#    'SMTP'        'UDP'                'Generic Streaming'
#    'LDAP'        'DNS (UDP)'
#
# If you're not sure, use 'Generic Streaming'.  The default valus is 'HTTP'.
#
# [*pool*]
# The name of the pool to associate with this virtual server. The default
# pool is 'discard' which drops all traffic.  See pool.pp for more information
# on pools.
#
# [*protection*]
# The service protection class to use.  Service protection is similar to an ACL
# that defines IP address that are banned and allowed.
#
# [*bandwidth*]
# The bandwidth management class to use. Bandwidth classes are used to
# limit the network resources that a set of connections can consume.
# When applied to a virtual server, they limit the bandwidth sending
# data to the clients.
#
# [*enabled*]
# Enable this virtual server to begin handling traffic?  The default is 'no'.
#
# [*ssl_decrypt*]
# Should this virtual server decrypt SSL traffic?  This offloads SSL
# processing from your nodes, and allows the virtual server to inspect
# and process the connection.  The default is 'no'.
#
# [*ssl_certificate*]
# The name of the SSL certificate to use when decrypting SSL connections.
# See ssl_certificate.pp for more information on importing SSL
# certificates for use with the Stingray Traffic Manager.
#
# [*request_rules*]
# If a request rule is needed, the name of the rule to use. See rule.pp for
# creating a rule.
#
# [*response_rules*]
# If a response rule is needed, the name of the rule to use. See rule.pp for
# creating a rule.
#
# [*enable_logging*]
# Should this virtual server log all requests? The default is 'no'.
#
# [*log_filename*]
# If enable_logging is set to 'yes', the name of the file in which to store
# the request logs.
#
# [*caching*]
# If set to 'yes' the Stingray Traffic Manager will attempt to cache web
# server responses. The default is 'no'.
#
# [*caching_time*]
# TTL for caching.  The default is undef so it's not populated.
#
# [*compression*]
# If set to 'yes' the Stingray Traffic Manager will attempt to compress
# content it returns to the browser. The default is 'no'.
#
# [*compression_level*]
# If compression is enabled, the compression level (1-9, 1=low, 9=high).
# The default is '1'.
#
# [*timeout*]
# A connection should be closed if no additional data has been received
# for this period of time. A value of 0 (zero) will disable this timeout.
# Note that the default value may vary depending on the protocol selected. 
#
# [*connect_timeout*]
# The time, in seconds, to wait for data from a new connection. If no data
# is received within this time, the connection will be closed. A value
# of 0 (zero) will disable the timeout. 
# The default is '10'.
#
# [*aptimizer_express*]
# Aptimizer Express is an add-on module for Stingray Traffic Manager that
# provides a set of robust optimizations to accelerate the delivery of
# most web pages, no configuration or tuning is required. This advanced 
# capability with Stingray Aptimizer Express is available as a licensed
# add-on module for Stingray Traffic Manager 9.5 and later.
